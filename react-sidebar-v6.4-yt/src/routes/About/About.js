      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my page, My name is Name and I am a full stack developer. I'm
        a passionate software developer with a strong commitment to creating
        effective, high-quality solutions. In my career, I’ve worked with
        Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Node, Flask, Docker and
        AWS, and I enjoy diving into new challenges, continuously learning, and
        pushing myself to stay at the forefront of technology. My competitive
        nature, rooted in a love for sports, drives me to strive for excellence
        in every project I take on. Outside of work, I’m a family-oriented
        person who values time spent with my wife, kids, and friends. Whether
        cheering at my kids' activities or gathering with loved ones, I find
        balance and inspiration in these connections. This supportive network
        motivates me to go the extra mile, both personally and professionally,
        as I pursue growth and aim to make a meaningful impact through my work.
